Classes are a fundamental construct in most modern programming languages. They bind together **data** and **functions** into a shared enviornment, exposing some of that data and function to other program elements for collaboration. They are the primary construct in object-oriented languages, **but are also useful with other approaches too.**

When I see a group of functions that operate closely together on a common body of data (usually passed as arguments to the function call), I see an opportunity to form a class. Using a class makes the common environment that these functions share more explicit, allows me to simplify function calls inside the object by removing many of the arguments, and provides a reference to pass such an object to other parts of the system.

In addition to organising already formed functions, this refactoring also provides a good opportunity to identify other bits of computation and refactor them into methods on the new class.
