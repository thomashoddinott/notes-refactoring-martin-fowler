### Notes

Function declarations represent how these parts fit together--effectively, they represent the joints in our software systems. And, as with any construction, much depends on those joints.

The only right answer to this puzzle is that there is no right answer, **especially over time**. So I find it's essential to be familiar with Change Function Declaration so the code can evolve with my understanding of what the best joints int he code need to be.

Often, a good way to improve a name is to write a comment to describe the function's purpose, then turn that comment into a name.
