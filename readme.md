do a `npm install` to run the tests with Jest - `npm test` 

`npm test -- --watch` to run tests on save. Leave it running in a terminal. This is handy for refactoring (compile-test-commit).

## Foreword & Preface

Refactoring is not a once-a-year ritual.

> The more you dig, the more stuff you turn up...and the more changes you make. Eventually you dig yourself into a hole you can't get out of. To avoid digging your own grave, refactoring must be done systematically. 

> He [Kent Beck] did several things differently, but one of the most important changes was to insist on continuous cleaning up of the code using refactoring.

What is Refactoring?

> Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in a way that does not alter the external behaviour of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimises the chances of introducing bugs. In essence, when you refactor, **you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.**

## Chapter 1: Refactoring: A First Example

### worked example: [ch1](./ch1) 

### notes

Add structure first (functions, classes) to help understand the code. Then make changes. This is positive feedback loop: add some structure ==> gain more understanding ==> transfer that understanding from your head to the code by adding some more structure ==> gain more understanding ==> ...

The true test of good code is how easy it is to change it.

More lines of code to set better structure is absolutely worth it.

With that said, if the code works and never needs to change. i.e. no one will **ever** read it again, it's fine to leave it alone!

The first step of refactoring: **tests** 

[./ch1/tests/statement.test.js](./ch1/tests/statement.test.js)

Naming is important and tricky. Don't dwell on it for too long. If your naming is awkward you can always change it on the next pass.

Baby steps - e.g. see commit log for [./ch1/statement.js](https://github.com/thomashoddinott/notes-refactoring-martin-fowler/commits/master/ch1/statement.js) and [./ch1/createStatementData.js](https://github.com/thomashoddinott/notes-refactoring-martin-fowler/commits/master/ch1/createStatementData.js).

Don't worry about performance. If your refactoring introduces slow-downs, finish refactoring and then optimise the slow part of code.

Always leave the code base healthier than when you found it. It will never be perfect, but it should be better. 

Read the code, gain some insight, and use refactoring to move that insight from your head back into the code.

## Chapter 2: Principles in Refactoring

**Refactoring** (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behaviour.

Refactoring is all about applying small behaviour-preserving steps and making a big change b stringing together a sequence of these behaviour-preserving steps.

**The two hats**: adding functionality, and refactoring. As we develop software, we find ourselves swapping hats frequently.

### Why Refactor?

- Improves the design of software - Hastily written, poorly designed code will get out the door fast, but its functionality will not scale with time.

- Makes software easier to understand

- Finds bugs - "I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits." 

- Write programs faster - as a consequence of the above!

### When Refactor? 

**The Rule of Three** - The first time, you just do it. The second time you do something similar, you wince at the duplication, but duplicate anyway. The third time, you refactor.

**Preparatory Refactoring** - Making it easier to add a feature. 

**Comprehension Refactoring** - Making code easier to understand. 

Often the best way to understand an unfamiliar piece of code you've been tasked on working on (assuming it needs refactoring!).

**Litter-Pickup Refactoring** - You understand what the code is doing but realise it's doing it badly.

**Planned and Opportunistic Refactoring** 

"I don't set aside time at the beginning to spend on refactoring--instead, I do refactoring as part of adding a feature of fixing a bug. It's part of my natural flow of programming."

**Long-Term Refactoring**

"... Even in such cases [where the refactoring will take weeks], I'm reluctant to have a team do dedicated refactoring. Often, a useful strategy is to agree to gradually work on the problem over the course of the next few weeks. **Whenever anyone goes near any code that's in the refactoring zone, they move it a little way in the direction they want to improve.** This takes advantage of the fact that refactoring doesn't break the code--each small change leaves everything in a still-working state."

**Refactoring in a Code Review**

Pair programming works well when refactoring someone's code. The author can provide content on the code and fully appreciate the reviewers' intentions for their changes. 

**What Do I Tell My Manager?**

Good managers appreciate and encourage refactoring. If yours doesn't, don't tell! - Refactoring is your duty as a professional software developer. 

**When Should I Not Refactor?**

1. Some ugly code that works but you never need to modify. Treat it as an API.
2. When it's actually easier to rewrite the code! Takes experience to learn how to judge this.

### Problems with Refactoring

**Slowing Down New Features**

It very likely will at the start, but "we refactor because it makes us faster [in the long run]--faster to add features, faster to fix bugs". 

Communicate the **economic benefits** of refactoring to managers and customers. 

**Code Ownership**

A preference for team code ownership. Programmers may still have individual responsibility of a system. 

Some teams encourage an open-source-like model where people from other teams can change a branch of their code and send the commit in to be approved (Pull Request). 

**Branches**

(The Continuous Integration vs Feature Branches debate) - see https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html

My 2 cents: I think it's a good idea, but as a junior programmer, or as someone learning a new codebase, I wouldn't feel so comfortable doing it. Wait until you're experienced and familiar with the code (and its standards) that you're working on?

**Testing**

Can't start without 'em. 

**Legacy Code**

A great opportunity in refactoring to turn legacy code into a polished gem :gem:. A common dragon :dragon: is a lack of tests! 

**Databases**

You can now. The essence of the technique is to combine the structural changes to a database's schema and access code with data migration scripts that ca easily *compose* to handle large changes.

### Refactoring, Architecture, and Yagni

"Adopting yagni (you aren't going to need it) doesn't mean I neglect all upfront architectural thinking. There are still cases where refactoring changes are difficult and some preparatory thinking can save time. But the balance has shifted a long way--I'm much more inclined to deal with issues later when I understand them better. All this has led to a growing discipline of evolutionary architecture where architects explore the patterns and practices that take advantage of our ability to iterate over architectural decisions."

### Refactoring and the Wider Software Development Process

In reality most agile projects only use the name. To really operate in an agile way, a team has to be capable and enthusiastic refactorers.

In a team, Continuous Integration is encouraged. Allows each member's refactoring efforts to be shared quickly with colleagues and no one builds on interfaces that are being removed. 

These three work nicely together: **self-testing code, continuous integration, refactoring**
