do a `npm install` to run the tests with Jest - `npm test` 

`npm test -- --watch` to run tests on save - this is handy for refactoring (compile-test-commit).

## Foreword & Preface

Refactoring is not a once-a-year ritual.

> The more you dig, the more stuff you turn up...and the more changes you make. Eventually you dig yourself into a hole you can't get out of. To avoid digging your own grave, refactoring must be done systematically. 

> He [Kent Beck] did several things differently, but one of the most important changes was to insist on continuous cleaning up of the code using refactoring.

What is Refactoring?

> Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in a way that does not alter the external behaviour of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimises the chances of introducing bugs. In essence, when you refactor, **you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.**
